/*
 * It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. 
 * Since Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance involving multiple inheritance is also not possible with classes. 
 * In Java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement Hybrid inheritance.
 * However, it is important to note that Hybrid inheritance does not necessarily require the use of Multiple Inheritance exclusively. 
 * It can be achieved through a combination of Multilevel Inheritance and Hierarchical Inheritance with classes, Hierarchical and Single Inheritance with classes. 
 * Therefore, it is indeed possible to implement Hybrid inheritance using classes alone, without relying on multiple inheritance type.
