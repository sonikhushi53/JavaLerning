/*
 * In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes. 
 * In the below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for the derived class C. 
 * In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparentâ€™s members by super.
